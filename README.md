### Project description
This system is to help manage F0 who receive homecare.  Recently, there are a surge in number of F0 which overloads the health system. Many F0 need to stay home. Therefore, there is a need to have a system to manage F0. This system should allow F0 to self-register or someone will help reigster them (for old patients). F0 will be auto or manually assigned to a doctor.  Everyday, F0 will need to log their vital signs. Everyday, a doctor will login to system and see their patients vital signs. If there is any problem he will recommend the F0 to go to hospital.
